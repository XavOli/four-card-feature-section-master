## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind Framework

### What I learned

This was my first time using Tailwind to create my own solution. I had only done follow-along small projects before.

### Continued development

I did not use any custom parameters in Tailwind and only used the pre-determined values. Adding some custom values would've allowed me to get a solution closed to the screenshots.
